## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Float
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I think what I learned in this challenge is, a good UI design should make sense to the developer. I found myself questioning many of the design choices here, and the conclusion I came to was that, this was a challenge that's made to challenge the developer, namely when it comes to patience.

I wanted to Make a Project using Floats
